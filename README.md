# 🧠 Quantum Superposition Experiment with Hadamard Gate

This project demonstrates how a single qubit, when passed through a Hadamard gate, enters a state of quantum superposition — producing a probabilistic outcome upon measurement.

---

## 🧪 Quantum Circuit Overview


---

## 📖 Interpretation

- The **Hadamard gate** created a perfect 50/50 superposition.
- The **measurement collapses** the state randomly.
- **Observed deviation (0.4%)** is due to normal quantum randomness.
- Repeating with **more shots (e.g. 2000)** yields even closer results to ideal distribution.

## 🧠 Why This Matters?

This experiment shows:
- True randomness of quantum systems
- Basics of quantum probability
- Real-world imperfections in ideal theory

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 3
- Qiskit
- IBM Quantum Experience / local simulator

---

## 📚 Next Steps

- Multi-qubit superposition circuits
- Entanglement (Bell States)
- Quantum teleportation basics
